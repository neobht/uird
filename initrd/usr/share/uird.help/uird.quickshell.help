Wellcome to QuickShell - a simple linux command line mode!
Use it to manage your files and to edit configs before booting target OS.

All of your disks are mounted in /mnt dir.
You can use an all included busybox commands (see output of 'ls /bin').
Also there are available some additional commands (see output of 'ls /usr/bin'):
 automount - to remount all disks, and to plug new USB drives;
 exit      - to continue booting MagOS
 poweroff  - to power off :)
